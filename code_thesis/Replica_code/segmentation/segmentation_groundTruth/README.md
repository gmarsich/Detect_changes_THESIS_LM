Execute `get_matrixDistance_listObjects.py` changing the variables at the beginning to get some useful files concerning the frl apartments in the Replica dataset. The environment that should be used is `sceneGraphs_groundTruth_Replica`.
Same applies for `colorDict_frlApartments.py`.

The files that one gets from here are all the files one needs fro the scene graph, except for the point cloud with tth IDs that is generated somewhere else.
