STEPS:

- use A_create_objectsJSON.py
- use B_create_npy_files.py to get the .npy files (each .npy file basically contains a point cloud)
- use C_create_pkl_files.py to get the .pkl files (each .pkl file contains a dictionary)
- D_create_new_dictionary.py is the basis to get the new_dict_that will be used as input for SGAligner. No need to run it here
